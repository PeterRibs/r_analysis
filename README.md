# R Display Analysis

Using real data collected in the field, I answered some questions about the reproductive behavior of a species of bird called Swallow-Tailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia caudata). Each question was answered using a separate file and independent of the other questions. The file name will be after the questions asked. The graphs and tables produced in order to answer the questions are in the 'Graphs' folder or 'https://peterribs.github.io/r_analysis/'. The names of the figures are as 'FIG_'+'name of the file that gave origin'.

## Questions:

- Display entropy change with different number of males displaying?
- Female visitation rate is related to recurrence parameters?
- The male success (copulation) is related to recurrence parameters?

## Technologies used:

- R

## Used R packages:

- car
- dplyr
- factoextra
- fitdistrplus
- ggplot2
- gridExtra
- heatmaply
- lme4
- MASS
- multcomp

- regclass

## Run

To run each one use the `main.py` file uncommenting the part of the question of interest.
